# cityfellowtravelers
City fellow travelers is a project created for people who want to find fellow travelers for trips around the city.
The advantage of such joint trips is that fellow travelers share the cost of the trip, thereby saving money on it. It also reduces traffic congestion and reduces emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere.
The peculiarity of this application is that it is closely related to maps. Fellow passengers search among all nearby routes of drivers within a certain radius.

You can download the app for android on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cifetra.cityfellowtravelers) or in the Releases section.
